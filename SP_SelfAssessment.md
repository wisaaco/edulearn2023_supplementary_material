# RESULTS FROM STUDENTâ€™S POINT OF VIEW

## 4.2. Self-assessment

**I am interviewing a painter who has exhibited his new work, what questions could I ask him?**

> Here are some questions you could ask a painter who has exhibited their new work:
> 
> 1. What inspired you to create this new body of work?
> 2. Can you tell us about the themes or ideas that you explored in this exhibition?
> 3. How has your artistic style or approach evolved since your last exhibition?
> 4. What were some of the challenges you faced while creating this work?
> 5. Can you walk us through your creative process for this exhibition?
> 6. Are there any specific artists or movements that influenced this work?
> 7. Which piece in the exhibition is your favorite and why?
> 8. How do you want viewers to feel or react when they see your work?
> 9. What do you hope people take away from this exhibition?
> 10. What are your plans for future artistic projects?


**How would you assess the suitability of this question within the previous questions and in the nature of the interview?**
**- Are your paintings expensive?

> This question may not be suitable for the nature of the interview as it focuses on the price of the paintings rather than the artistic value, creative process, or inspiration behind the works. It may also come across as impolite or inappropriate to the artist. It would be better to focus on questions related to the artist's creative process, inspiration, technique, and themes explored in their artwork.

## 4.3 Support for learning tasks

**Can you explain the difference between solar and lunar calendars?**

> Solar and lunar calendars are two types of calendars used by different cultures around the world.

A solar calendar is based on the length of the solar year, which is the time it takes for the Earth to complete one orbit around the sun. A typical solar year is approximately 365.24 days long, and solar calendars usually have 365 or 366 days in a year to account for this.

In contrast, a lunar calendar is based on the cycles of the moon. A typical lunar cycle, or lunar month, is 29.5 days long, so lunar calendars usually have either 12 or 13 months in a year. The length of a lunar year is approximately 354 days, which is shorter than a solar year. This means that lunar calendars need to add an extra month periodically to keep the calendar in sync with the solar year.

One key difference between the two types of calendars is that a solar calendar is more closely aligned with the changing seasons, while a lunar calendar is more closely aligned with the phases of the moon. This can lead to differences in how holidays and events are celebrated or observed, depending on which calendar is used. For example, the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, while the Gregorian calendar, used in much 

**What is gravity?**

> Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that causes two bodies to attract each other. It is the force that pulls objects towards each other, like the force that pulls you towards the Earth. The strength of the gravitational force depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them.

According to Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity, gravity is the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass or energy. This means that massive objects like stars and planets create a "dip" in spacetime, and objects moving nearby are pulled towards them along the curvature of spacetime.

Gravity is a fundamental force that plays a crucial role in many aspects of physics and astrophysics, from keeping planets in orbit around stars to shaping the structure of the universe itself.

**What is gravity for primary school students**


> Gravity is the force that pulls things towards each other. It is what makes things fall down when you drop them. The Earth has gravity, which is why we stay on the ground instead of floating away. The strength of gravity depends on how big an object is and how close it is to other objects. That's why the Moon stays in orbit around the Earth, and why the Earth stays in orbit around the Sun. Gravity is an important force in the universe, and it helps to keep everything in its place!

**What is gravity for secondary school students. Include the fundamental equations**

> Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that causes two bodies to attract each other. It is described by the law of universal gravitation, which states that the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:

F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2

where F is the force of gravity, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, r is the distance between them, and G is the gravitational constant. The gravitational constant is a fundamental physical constant that has a value of approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 N * m^2 / kg^2.

The equation above can be used to calculate the force of gravity between any two objects with mass. For example, it can be used to calculate the force of gravity between the Earth and an object on its surface. The force of gravity between the Earth and an object with mass m is given by:

F = G * (m1 * m) / r^2

where m1 is the mass of the Earth and r is the radius of the Earth (or the distance from the center of the Earth to the object's surface).

Gravity also plays a crucial role in Einstein's theory of General Relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass or energy. The equations used to describe General Relativity are much more complex and involve advanced mathematics, but they provide a more accurate description of gravity at very large scales or in extreme conditions, such as near a black hole.
