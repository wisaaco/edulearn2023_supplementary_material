# RESULTS FROM STUDENTâ€™S POINT OF VIEW

## 4.2. Self-assessment

** I am interviewing a painter who has exhibited his new work, what questions could I ask him?

> Here are some questions you could ask a painter who has exhibited their new work:
> 
> 1. What inspired you to create this new body of work?
> 2. Can you tell us about the themes or ideas that you explored in this exhibition?
> 3. How has your artistic style or approach evolved since your last exhibition?
> 4. What were some of the challenges you faced while creating this work?
> 5. Can you walk us through your creative process for this exhibition?
> 6. Are there any specific artists or movements that influenced this work?
> 7. Which piece in the exhibition is your favorite and why?
> 8. How do you want viewers to feel or react when they see your work?
> 9. What do you hope people take away from this exhibition?
> 10. What are your plans for future artistic projects?


** How would you assess the suitability of this question within the previous questions and in the nature of the interview?
**- Are your paintings expensive?

> This question may not be suitable for the nature of the interview as it focuses on the price of the paintings rather than the artistic value, creative process, or inspiration behind the works. It may also come across as impolite or inappropriate to the artist. It would be better to focus on questions related to the artist's creative process, inspiration, technique, and themes explored in their artwork.
